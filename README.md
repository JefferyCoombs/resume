# My Resume 
### In which I finally learn LaTeX

I've been meaning to learn LaTeX for a few years now. I've always hated working in Word. The most recent iteration of my resume was made in InDesign, an application I have no interest in actually knowing.  

LaTeX makes sense for me, because I would way rather write markup in Vim than mess around with a complex graphical interface. Another bonus is that I can use git to manage versions, branching to customize my cover letter for a particular job.
